Hi there, I'm Radouane Bahi 👋
I'm a graduate from the Flatiron School's Access Labs where I studied JavaScript, React, Ruby, Rails, and Redux. My original pursuit was to be a police officer, but after I had gotten my Bachelor's in Criminal Justice from John Jay College, I realize just how limiting that career would have been. Working with code has allowed me to feel like I am contributing to something more than myself, that I am a part of this world's technological drive.

Coding was always something that piqued my interest, even dabbling in HTML when I was a pre-teen. A friend of mine who had also attended Flatiron recommended the school to me. After taking the pre-coursework, I got hooked and wanted to immerse myself into the world completely. Graduated in late March 2020 and I am still learning as much as I can to keep myself sharp for the industry.

I'm looking for opportunities! Please contact me using my LinkedIn or at radbahi@gmail.com
