          My name is Radouane Bahi. I am a graduate from the Flatiron School. I
          got into software engineering from a friend who recommended it to me
          after I decided to not pursue a career in law enforcement following my
          graduation from John Jay College. Figures that I'd have a change of
          heart right after graduation! Please take the time to click on the
          links to the left leading to my projects and social media/blogs.
